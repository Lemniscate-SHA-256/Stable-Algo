 Brain-Inspired Concepts in Rust
Sparse Autoencoder:

Use the ndarray crate for tensor operations.

Enforce sparsity with k-WTA (Winner-Take-All) activation.

Predictive Coding:

Implement a predictive RNN (using candle-rs or tch-rs for Torch bindings).

C. Quantum-Inspired Compression
Qubit Simulation:

Use the qrust or quantum crate to simulate qubit-based entropy coding.

Superposition Codes:

Encode multiple symbols in a single "quantum state" (e.g., probabilistic bits).
